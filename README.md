# SaferString
Safer String provides extension methods to reduce the attack surface when converting Strings to SecureStrings in C#.

## Disclamer
THIS WAS BORN OUT OF A SECURITY RESEARCH PROJECT OF MINE.  **I HOLD NO RESPONSIBILITY** FOR END USE OF THIS LIBRARY.  ALTHOUGH THIS REDUCES THE ATTAKC SURFACE IT BY NO MEANS ELEMINATES IT.  MAKE SECURITY A FIRST CLASS CITIZEN IN YOUR APPLICATION AND USE SECURESTRINGS FROM THE BEGINNING.
