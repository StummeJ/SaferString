For the post-build event NuGet.exe and NuGetPack.exe are required.
You can add them to your solution by adding the "PubComp.NuGetPack" NuGet package to the solution via the NuGet package manager.

1. You can modify the package metadata by editing NuGetPack.config.
2. To include projects in this package, add project references to this project.
3. To include dependencies on external NuGet packages, add NuGet package references to this project.
4. To include dependencies on other NuGet packages created in this solution, add them to the internalPackages.config file.
5. To synchronize the package version with the version of the assemblies included in it, use a shared AssemblyInfo.cs file for the source projects and the NuGet package projects.
6. To add system reference to the package, add them as references to this project and set AddFrameworkReferences to true in the config file.
